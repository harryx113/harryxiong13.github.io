              This project is a face mask detector that supports image and live
              video face mask detection built with TensorFlow and OpenCV.
              The goal of this project is to transfer data science and deep
              learning skills learned from classes to solve a real-world problem.
              As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to expand, the demand of face
              mask detection grows accordingly. This project aims to help grocery
              stores, malls and other indoor venues with the "mask-on" policy.

              MobileNet V2: MobileNets are a class of small, low-latency, low-power
              models that can be used for classification, detection, and other commmon
              tasks. Because of their small size, these are considered great deep
              learning models to be used on mobile devices. I used the MobileNet V2
              pre-processing to efficiently process the input images.

              CNN architecture: Two layers of Conv2D and two layers of Max Pooling
              are used. 0.3 dropout rate and callback method are applied to avoid
              overfitting. The callback threshold is set at 0.95 to save computing resources.
